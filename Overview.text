"The Travel Planner" is a console-based application developed in C++ 
that utilizes Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to calculate the shortest path 
between cities. It simulates a basic navigation system by accepting 
city names and route distances, storing them in an adjacency matrix,
 and allowing the user to select a source city to calculate the
 shortest distance to all other cities.
